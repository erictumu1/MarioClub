        First one For writers, a random sentence can help them get their
        creative juices flowing. Since the topic of the sentence is completely
        unknown, it forces the writer to be creative when the sentence appears.
        There are a number of different ways a writer can use the random
        sentence for creativity. The most common way to use the sentence is to
        begin a story. Another option is to include it somewhere in the story. A
        much more difficult challenge is to use it to end a story. In any of
        these cases, it forces the writer to think creatively since they have no
        idea what sentence will appear from the tool.
